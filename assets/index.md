#  Hi, I'm Zolile Zoko

 Final-Year BScEng (Electrical & Computer Engineering) Student  
 Cape Town, South Africa  

I‚Äôm an aspiring embedded systems and digital design engineer with a strong passion for building real-world solutions through code and hardware. My interests lie at the intersection of **embedded systems**, **FPGA design**, **wireless/mobile networks**, and **digital signal processing**.

Whether it's programming microcontrollers, optimizing logic on FPGAs, or exploring network protocols, I enjoy solving complex problems through thoughtful engineering.

> ‚ÄúDesign is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.‚Äù ‚Äì Steve Jobs

## About Me

I'm an aspiring embedded systems engineer who loves working hands-on with hardware.  
From designing PCBs for autonomous robots to programming signal processors on FPGA, I bring together hardware and code to create powerful systems.

In 2024, I co-developed a micromouse robot that aimed to make use of sensors and real-time control to navigate mazes efficiently. Currently, I'm working on implementing waveform generation and signal acquisition modules in my final-year HF radar project using RedPitaya and FPGA programming.

##  Projects
 
### üîß Lumkani Network Utility Tool HAT Redesign

During a 4-week internship at **Lumkani**, a company focused on fire detection systems for low-income households, I was tasked with redesigning their **Network Utility Tool HAT** ‚Äî transitioning it from a button-based interface to a **touchscreen-based solution**.

#### Key Contributions:
- **Refactored legacy code** for improved readability and maintainability.
- **Designed a custom breakout PCB** integrating:
  - RFM69HW radio transceiver
  - Voltage monitoring circuitry
  - WTC32C01 touchscreen module with LVGL-based UI
- Employed **via stitching** to enhance signal integrity and grounding, and **optimized component placement** to improve data accuracy.
- Developed a responsive **touchscreen interface** using **LVGL** for efficient field testing of fire detectors.

 **Impact:** The redesigned tool significantly improved productivity by streamlining the process of validating and configuring new fire detectors during development and deployment.

###  Yagi UDA Antenna Design
- Designed and Simulated a Yagi antenna for 1.3GHz operation, optimizing element lengths and spacings for maximum gain and minimal reflection coefficient.
- Measured Performance using a HyperLog transmitting antenna and analyzed reflection coefficient and gain across frequencies.
- Results: The antenna‚Äôs best performance occurred at 1.24GHz (-9.34dB reflection coefficient), which is 5% lower than the design frequency. The peak gain (-28.83dB) was observed at 1.28GHz, within the design bandwidth.
- Validated Performance using the Friis Transmission Equation to calculate received power and compare with expected values, confirming the antenna‚Äôs real-world efficiency.
